Revision history for Perl extension HTTP::Throwable

0.010
    - NOT BACKWARD COMPATIBLE
    - significantly rewritten by rjbs, in terms of roles rather than subclasses
        - re-read the documentation!
    - HTTP::Throwable::Factory is now the piece intended most for end users
    - should be significantly easier to both use and extend

    - add proper support for RFC 2324 (thanks rjbs)
    - allowing more than one Proxy-Authenticate header
      (thanks to chansen for pointing this out, though he
      could have mentioned it before I released 0.004 :P)

0.004 Sat. Feb. 12, 2011
    - allowing more than one WWW-Authenticate header

    - introspection for status code via is_redirect, is_client_error and
      is_server_error (Brian Cassidy)

0.002 Tues. Feb. 8, 2011
    - normalize *_location attributes to all be
      called location, since that is the name of the
      header
    - any time we allow additional headers to be
      passed in, the attribute is now called
      additional_headers instead of whatever it was
      before (usually cache_headers)
    - change the valid_methods attribute in
      HTTP::Throwable::MethodNotAllowed to be just
      allow (which is what the header is)
        - improved the type check on this as well
    - make the exceptions also function as PSGI apps
        - add to_app method
        - support &{} overload
        - added tests for this
    - overload stringification
        - added tests for this
